## A Trip to the Pumpkin Patch

Fall is easily my favorite season. I love everything about it, the sights, the smells, the intentional time spent with family getting outdoors and making memories together. Ever since my Mom's passing, my husband and I have been really trying to be intentional with our time. Whether it's time spent the Lord, our famiy, each other, or time spent working on hobbies, we try to waste time as little as possible. 



My most treasured memories as a little girl is going to the pumpkin patch and I hope it becomes one of Grant's favorite memories as well. We go to Huber's Farm, it's a little place in Southern Indiana and they have the hayrides, farmer's market, and lots of fun activities for little ones (and a winery for the adults ;) ) We spent the day with our sisters and their significant others and we couldn't have dreamed up a better day. We shot these photos with our Pentax Film camera.
