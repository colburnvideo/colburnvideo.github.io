## Herb Skillet Potatoes


My father in law bought me a cast iron skillet and ya'll, this is life changing. One of my favorite things to cook in the skillet is Skillet Potatoes because they're versatile and so yummy!

Ingredients: 

- Yukon Gold Potatoes
- Rosemary
- Thyme
- Oregano
- Olive Oil
- Salt + Pepper 
- Garlic Powder

Start by heating up the pan with 1 Tb of Olive Oil. Wait until the pan is hot (move your skillet around to fully coat the bottom)

Cut up potatoes ** make sure they are all cut around the same size so this ensures even cooking **

- Add your spices to taste (I usually end up doing about a 1 1/2 tsp of each and about 1/2 teaspoon of pepper)

- Add herbs - chop herbs finely, about a teaspoon each, or to taste 

- Cook with whole garlic clove and sprig of Rosemary

- Sautee for about 7 minutes on medium heat, until the potatoes brown

Chop up some cherry tomatoes to toss in with the potatoes. 

Cook an egg however you like (I poached mine) and serve over top of potatoes

Serve with arugula (drizzle a little lemon over the arugula, trust me!) and a side of Turkey Sausage. I just used store-bought and this protein packed breakfast will start your day off right!! Oh, and it's dairy free too ;) 

happy cooking!
