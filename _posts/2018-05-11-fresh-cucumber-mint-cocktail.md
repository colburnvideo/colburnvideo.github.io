## Fresh Cucumber Mint Cocktail

I don't know what the weather is like where you live but in Louisville Kentucky, summer gets hot. It's the running joke that we have two seasons, winter and summer. We just sort of, skip over spring and fall. We're either freezing or sweating. So, in the honor of it being (unofficially) summer here, I've decided to share an old favorite cocktail which is perfect for those hot, but oh so sweet summer nights.

I'm not a huge fan of super sweet cocktails so this one is a personal favorite of mine because it's just enough sweet without the "hit you over the head knock you flat" with sugar sweet. If you're not a veggie fan, no worries, the lime juice really shines through and the cucumber is more of a hiding behind the scenes sneakily adding in that freshness you taste flavor.

The best thing about this cocktail is it's so easy to make, it's pretty, and looks impressive to your guests with minimal effort (and who doesn't LOVE that??)

You don't have to use cucumber vodka. If you have the time, muddle the cucumber and mint together and strain out the seeds. Substitue with regular vodka. But I like things easy so I bought the prairie cucumber vodka. I bought this for about $20 but there are cheaper options available.

## Directions

I start with my glasses. I muddle the mint in the bottom of the glass then take out the mint leaves. Make your simple syrup - equal parts water and sugar.

Add 1.5 ounces of cucumber vodka (the beauty of this is, you can add as much as you want)

Pour 1/2 cup of club soda

Add 1/4 cup of simple syrup

Juice from 1/2 lime

Stir.

Taste your drink as you go and adjust the ingredients. It's fun to experiment, don't be afraid to fail.

Pour into glass, decorate with cucumber and mint and enjoy!
