## Thanksgiving Tablescape

I can't believe it's already time to start thinking about the holidays! I know it's only October, but the air is getting cooler (except in Kentucky ... it's supposed to be 86 degrees this week because ... Kentucky) *insert the biggest eye roll ever here* and summer is offically behind us! 

Fall is actually my favorite time of year. It brings a much needed refreshment to the world. After months of draining hot summer days and nights, fall sweeps in and fills us with all the good feels and all the pumpkin spice lattes. Along with the changing seasons, I love to change up my house every season. This doesn't mean let's throw pumpkins in every corner, I simply mean, I love to change up the colors and textures to give my home a more fall-like "feel". Don't get me wrong, I love beautifully decorated fall decor and pumpkins but personally, it's not my style. I don't think that particular style works for my home, whereas I think it fits beautifully in others'! 

I wanted to share my fall table with you guys - this will also be the decor for our Thanksgiving table! I went in a little different direction this year than normally. It's darker, moodier, with a pop of color. I really wanted to challenge myself instead of falling back on my usual light and bright decorating style.

The inspiration for the table were these [glasses](https://www.worldmarket.com/product/copper-omber-rim-drinkware-collection.do?sortby=ourPicks&from=fn) that I saw while strolling through World Market looking for inspiration. I loved how they looked next to the black buffet [napkins](https://www.worldmarket.com/product/black-buffet-napkins%2C-set-of-6.do?sortby=ourPicks&from=Search) (also from world market) I already had the candlesticks and white pillar [candles](https://www.target.com/p/pillar-candle-sugared-birch-hearth-hand-153-with-magnolia/-/A-52991731). I picked up these black pillar [candles](https://www.target.com/p/pillar-candle-3-x6-cedar-magnolia-hearth-hand-153-with-magnolia/-/A-52588206?ref=tgt_adv_XS000000&AFID=google_pla_df&CPNG=PLA_Home+Decor+Shopping_Priority+Brands&adgroup=SC_Hearth&Hand&LID=700000001170770pgs&network=g&device=c&location=9052921&gclid=Cj0KCQjwi8fdBRCVARIsAEkDvnJ8HF3LgsDQCH3mQcN2p3OxgH3TmzCC36YXRqRmIWCe6brQ0jusSqIaAsbBEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) from Target

This is usually where I start in any decorating design challenge. I find one thing that inspires me and decorate around it. I've always been obsessed with magnolia leaves and since we don't have a tree in our yard, my sweet friend let me come over and take some of hers. The magnolia leaves are just placed on the table, they're not strung together into a garland.

I cut up pieces from one of Hobby Lobby's faux floral fall decor and placed a few pieces in the magnolia leaves to add a pop of color.

My plates are from Kate Spade which we got from our wedding and the chargers are these brown plate [chargers](https://www.hobbylobby.com/search/?text=brown+plate+charger&quickview=40880) from Hobby Lobby. I used apples, oranges, figs, and eucalyptus for the place settings. I kept the white plates because I loved the contrast from the chargers + black napkins. The table runner is also from Target and can be found [here](https://www.target.com/p/gray-table-runner-threshold-153/-/A-52333720)

My biggest advice when decorating a table is to always keep in mind contrast and varying height! It makes your design more interesting and aesthetically pleasing to the eye.

But like I've always said, it's not always about what's on the table but who is around it. My favorite tables are always the ones where mis-matched chairs are crammed together with a plastic table at the end to accomodate more people. I hope your fall table is filled with laughter, joy, and lasting memories.
