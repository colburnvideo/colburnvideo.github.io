## Mother's Day Picnic

It was a firsts for Mother's Day this year for me. It was my first Mother's Day as a mother and my first without my mother. The day was filled as much joy as sorrow but I am so thankful for my sweet husband and baby boy who made it a day I'll never forget. 

My love languages are gifts and acts of service. My husband accomplished both. He set up the whole thing, cooked everything, and I got the "day off" from being a parent but still enjoyed all the sweet moments with my family. 

I was treated to a Mother's Day Picnic with all of my favorite foods and was gifted the most beautiful [picnic basket](https://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/store/product/picnic-time-reg-22-piece-insulated-picnic-basket-for-4/1062492577?categoryId=12346)!! He made and printed out the cutest little menu and best of all, the food he prepared is all dairy free!! (I'm currently dairy free beacuse of little man and his eczema)

We found a shaded and breezy spot in our favorite park, walking distance from our house. Our picnic started with roasted red pepper hummus, veggies, and crackers (no pictures because we devoured it immediately haha) 

Then pasta salad with pepper, balsamic, + cucumber

The picnic ended with a personal favorite of mine, Almond Butter Fudge. This is all Jordan's recipes, I didn't do anything!!! I will link the recipes in a little bit :) It's vegan too!

It was a perfect day, not only the flowers, sweet notes, and picnic, but the people who I got to share the day with. I'm still in awe of how the Lord blessed me with my sweet family. Even though there was so much hurt, there was so much joy and I'm thankful. I hope you all had a wonderful Mother's Day!
