## Mother's Day Picnic

It was a firsts for Mother's Day this year for me. It was my first Mother's Day as a mother and my first without my mother. The day was filled as much joy as sorrow but I am so thankful for my sweet husband and baby boy who made it a day I'll never forget. 

My love languages are gifts and acts of service. My husband accomplished both. He set up the whole thing, cooked everything, and I got the "day off" from being a parent but still enjoyed all the sweet moments with my family. 

I was treated to a Mother's Day Picnic with all of my favorite foods and was gifted the most beautiful [picnic basket](https://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/store/product/picnic-time-reg-22-piece-insulated-picnic-basket-for-4/1062492577?categoryId=12346)!!

We found a shaded and breezy spot in our favorite park, walking distance from our house. Our picnic started with roasted red pepper hummus, veggies, and crackers (no pictures because we devoured it immediately haha) 

Then pasta salad with pepper, balsamic, + cucumber
