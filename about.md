## The Beginning of Colburn Cottage


Hello! My name is Brooke and welcome to my home! I’m a follower of Jesus Christ, wife to my wonderful husband, Jordan, a Mom to the sweetest little boy who ever lived, Grant and dog Mom to St. Matthew’s cutest little hound, Copper.

I’m a wedding filmmaker alongside Jordan. We’ve been so fortunate and worked incredibly hard to grow our business to where it is today. We’ve been filming weddings for over five years and within those five years, we’ve filmed 100+ beautiful wedding days. We’ve also bought our very first house almost two years ago. Nestled in the middle of St. Matthews in Louisville, Kentucky sits our beautiful little home, Colburn Cottage. 

This website has a lot to do with my Mom. My Mom ALWAYS found the joy in the little things. She told me that her biggest dream in life is for our family to all live next door to each other in a cul de sac and we would drink sweet tea and watch the kids play as the sun set. Doesn’t this sound like such a Mom thing to say?! But now that I’m a Mom, I totally get it and nothing in this life would make me happier. 

My Mom loved decorating. She was so crafty, too. Growing up, she was always painting the back drops to Vacation Bible School, sewing curtains, making pillows, etc. She was so creative. She loved to cook and garden. So much of her I find in myself (minus the crafty part, ya’ll, I’m NOT crafty in the slightest sense haha) I love decorating, but this website is so much more than about home decor and sharing recipes. It’s about making your house feel like a home. My goal isn’t to impress people with my furniture or how I decorated that book shelf or the things I can cook. I want people to feel welcome, to feel safe, I want my house to be a refuge of sorts, where people can prop their feet up, enjoy a cup of coffee or glass of wine and feel comfortable enough to be present.

Whenever my Mom came to visit she told me how it was such a vacation for her. She said she always felt welcome and comfortable in my home. It was the highest compliment I’d ever received. We talked a lot about me starting this website to showcase not only home decor and recipes, but hospitality. Hospitality in a sense of being hospitable when people came over, of course, but also being open and transparent to others on a different kind of platform. She was such an encourager and believer in me. She was the one who told me my house was like a warm little cottage and with that, we always referred to my house as the Colburn Cottage. 

I started the Colburn Cottage Instagram account on October 2, 2017. She passed away on October 24, 2017. Colburn Cottage became painful to keep up with. So much of my home reminded me of her. But a little over six months after her passing, I’m launching our website on her birthday, May 3 in honor of her. 

I’m so glad you’re here. Thank you for being a part of my journey and I can’t wait to share my heart and open my home to you. We'd love to connect via social media as well! Find me on Pinterest and follow on Instagram! 

There is so much more to come.
